Open Humans is a platform that allows you to upload, connect, and privately store your personal data – such as genetic, activity, or social media data. Once you've added data, you can choose to donate it: you might choose to share some publicly , and you can join and contribute to diverse research projects. Thus, we turn the traditional research pipeline on its head: you are at the center and in control of when you share your data.

We want to empower you to explore your data – for example, enabling you to analyze your genome or your Twitter data. For researchers and citizen scientists, Open Humans offers a toolbox to easily create new projects which can efficiently ask an engaged audience of participants to join and contribute. or join research projects.

All of this makes Open Humans a vibrant community. People are intrigued by their own data! For this reason, there is no single user profile: we are researchers; patients; data scientists; citizen scientists; any and all people who want to learn more about themselves. And they have continued to be enthusiastic, motivated, and truly engaged in the work of the organization.

We'd love for you to join us in this, analyzing your data, creating projects and adding data sources. Together we can help empower a thriving community to make the best use of their personal data.
