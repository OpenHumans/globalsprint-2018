[Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org) is participating in the [2018 Global
Sprint](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/) that's
organized by Mozilla on May 10th and 11th. The *Global Sprint* is a two-day
collaborative hackathon that takes place around the globe - both at physical
locations as well as remotely via the web.

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to the *Open Humans*
ecosystem. As a [platform that connects people and their data with researchers
and projects that want to work with people and their data](https://www.openhumans.org/about/),
*Open Humans* is pretty decentralized. As such there is not a single repository that you can contribute to,
but rather a collection of repositories that you can contribute to.

Below you will find links to different projects that you can contribute to, along
with some first overviews which skill sets are needed and our estimated
level of difficulty. Our GitHub issues can be found in the [`OpenHumans/ohjh-example-notebooks`](https://github.com/OpenHumans/ohjh-example-notebooks/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amozsprint), [`gedankenstuecke/twitter-analyser`](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/twitter-analyser/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amozsprint) and [`gedankenstuecke/ftdna-upload`](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/ftdna-upload/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amozsprint) repositories. 

The best way to get in touch with us is by
[joining our slack](http://slackin.openhumans.org/). Drop by in our `#globalsprint`
channel. We're always excited to meet new people!
