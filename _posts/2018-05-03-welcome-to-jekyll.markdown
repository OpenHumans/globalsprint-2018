Open Humans runs it's own *JupyterHub* setup which allows people to explore their
personal data in notebooks written in *Python*, *R* and *Julia*. We are looking for
people to write more example notebooks and improve our documentation!

You can [find our example notebook documentation here](http://openhumansfoundation.org/ohjh-example-notebooks/).
The Notebooks [themselves can be found at GitHub](https://github.com/OpenHumans/ohjh-example-notebooks)
too and the notebooks found in the `master` branch of that repository are automatically
provided to each user's notebook server when they start it. This makes it a great
way to showcase your notebooks to many people who are just getting started!

Some new notebook ideas and improvement ideas can be found below and
[in the issues on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenHumans/ohjh-example-notebooks/issues).
To add your own notebook or improvements to existing notebooks just make a pull
request against that repository!

A general reminder for the *perceived difficulty*: If you are writing a notebook
on you own, the difficulty level is highly dependent on the kind of data analysis you want to perform in your notebook.
It could *"just"* be plotting some of the data that people have in their Open Humans
accounts. Or it could be a more complex task that correlates data sources, makes use
of external APIs etc. It's completely up to you.
