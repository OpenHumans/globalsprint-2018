[TwArχiv](http://twarxiv.org/) is an Open Humans project that allows people to upload
their full Twitter archive and analyses the user's metadata to check how their
Twitter behaviour changes over time and how geo-locations can be used to track their movement.

TwArχiv is a Django/Python project that makes use of the Pandas Python-library for the
data processing along with some JavaScript libraries to visualize the results.
The [code and documentation lives on GitHub](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/twitter-analyser),
where also some [issues can be found](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/twitter-analyser/issues)

## Ways to contribute

The project has been online since December 2017 but hasn't had many contributors so far.
As such it would be great if someone could check that the documentation is up to date
and helpful. This goes both for the `README.md` that describes the setup for the development
environment as well as the texts on the website itself.

All contributions so far come from people for whom English is a foreign language.
Due to that there's probably room for some copy-editing to smoothen things out.
Having a native speaker read over the texts would be highly appreciated.

## Add support for predicting non-binary genders

So far the TwArχiv predicts genders based on the first names of the users that
are replied to/retweeted. Ideally it should be able to scan the public Twitter
biographies of these users to check for pronouns to be more inclusive.

For this the data import needs to be adjusted, along with an integration of the
Twitter API itself to request these profiles.

## Adjust page so that expired Open Humans tokens lead to being logged out and request log in.

Right now it can happen that a user has a still-valid cookie to be logged in into the twitter analyser, but our stored access_token to interact with the open humans API is already expired. The only way for a user to resolve that situation at this point is to delete the cookie that stores the log-in to the twitter analyser. Which is far from ideal.

Ideally all pages that can trigger interactions with the Open Humans API should make sure to first check on whether the access token needs to be refreshed and perform this operation if needed. This is especially relevant for the JS upload pages, as there we are performing the upload through the JS on the page, so a check needs to be performed before rendering the page.

So far many parts of TwArχiv [are not covered by tests](https://codeclimate.com/github/gedankenstuecke/twitter-analyser).
If someone is as much of a test fan as [Bastian](https://www.twitter.com/gedankenstuecke) they can get started with that.

We have a CI setup that uses Travis and CodeClimate to check for the coverage.
