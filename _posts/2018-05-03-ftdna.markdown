[FamilyTreeDNA integration](https://www.openhumans.org/activity/familytreedna-integration/)
is an Open Humans project that allows people to upload
their genetic test results generated by the company *FamilyTreeDNA*.

The integration is a Django/Python project that makes use of *Celery* to check whether
uploaded files are valid.
The [code and documentation lives on GitHub](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/ftdna-upload),
where also some [issues can be found](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/ftdna-upload/issues)

Most contributions so far come from people for whom English is a foreign language.
Due to that there's probably room for some copy-editing to smoothen things out.
Having a native speaker read over the texts would be highly appreciated.
This goes both for the `README.md` that describes the setup for the development
environment as well as the texts on the website itself.

## Add support for further file formats

Quoting a potential user here:

> FamilyTreeDNA integration appears only to work for the FamilyTreeDNA Family
Finder test, not for any other testing they performed nor for testing they
did for The Genographic Project.

The problem is that our `celery` task scans files whether they are valid and it will delete files if they don't match the expected format. I have a couple of example files for the additional tests (e.g. Y-chromosomal STRs) that should be supported and be accepted too. I need to anonymize these first. Once that's done I can provide the general format. If someone wants to work on this I'll prioritize it.
